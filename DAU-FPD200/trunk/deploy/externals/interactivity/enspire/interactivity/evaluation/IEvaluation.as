/*
   Interface: IEvaluation
    
	Evaluations are bundles of data representing the current state of an activity. More specifically,
	these are bundles generated whenever the user's answer or completion of an activity is being assessed.
	In practical terms, evaluations are generated whenever the 'submit' button is pressed. 
	
	All evaluations should implement the following interface. At the most basic, they should all encapsulate
	the correctness of the user's answer, and the current number of tries/attempts by the user.

	/* Function: getCorrect
       Returns true if the user's most recent attempt at the interactivity was correct, false otherwise.
    */
	function getCorrect():Boolean;
	
	/* Function: getNumTries
       Returns the number of times that the user has attempted the current interactivity. The first evaluation
	   generated by the activity will return 1 when getNumTries() is called on it.
